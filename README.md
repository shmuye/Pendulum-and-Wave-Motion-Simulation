# Pendulum and Wave Motion Simulation

This repository contains an interactive 3D web-based simulation that demonstrates two fundamental concepts in physics: pendulum motion and wave propagation.

Built with Three.js, this application provides a visual and engaging way to understand oscillatory motion and wave dynamics in real time.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create an intuitive and interactive simulation that allows users to explore and observe the behavior of a realistic pendulum and a dynamic wave pattern.

The pendulum's motion is based on sine wave functions, and the wave simulation uses multiple oscillating objects to form a smooth wave.

## Features

- **Realistic Pendulum Simulation**: Features a bob and rod connected to a pivot, animated using trigonometric functions.
- **Dynamic Wave Simulation**: Multiple animated bars driven by sine functions simulate smooth wave propagation.
- **Interactive Camera Controls**: Users can explore the 3D scene from different angles using OrbitControls.
- **Basic Lighting**: Includes ambient and directional lights for enhanced realism.
- **Math-Driven Animation**: All 3D objects are animated based on mathematical principles.
- **Real-time Rendering**: Immediate visual feedback from WebGL rendering.
- **User Interaction (Planned)**: Future enhancements will allow adjustment of pendulum parameters (length, mass, damping) and wave properties (amplitude, frequency).

## üß± Planned 3D Objects

1. **Pendulum Bob** ‚Äì A spherical object representing the swinging mass.
2. **Pendulum Rod** ‚Äì A cylindrical object connecting the bob to the pivot.
3. **Pendulum Pivot** ‚Äì A fixed anchor point for the rod.
4. **Wave Bars** ‚Äì A group of boxes that oscillate to simulate wave-like motion.
5. **Ground Plane** ‚Äì A textured base for context in the scene.

## üß™ Methodology

### 1. Scene Setup

- Establish the 3D environment with the pendulum system and wave objects.

### 2. Physics Implementation

- Use trigonometric functions (sine/cosine) for pendulum swinging.
- Use time-based sine displacement for wave motion.

### 3. User Interaction _(Planned)_

- Enable users to modify pendulum and wave properties like amplitude, frequency, length, etc.

### 4. Visual Enhancements

- Add textures and lighting.
- Integrate OrbitControls for camera navigation.

### 5. Testing & Optimization

- Ensure performance is smooth across browsers and devices.
